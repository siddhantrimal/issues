	"content": "Before doing anything, Install all the pre-requisites properly\n\rPlease follow the steps, in proper order, for successful installation\n Open SQL Server Management Studio 2012(may be named as SQL Management Studio)\n If it didn\u0026rsquo;t open or, isn\u0026rsquo;t present, your installation of SQL Server 2012 Enterprise is improper.  Re-install SQL Server 2012 Enterprise and select these relevant options   Click here to view Step-by-step walkthrough   This walkthrough will guide you through the proper installation steps\n On the pre-requisites page, you will find link to download SQL Server 2012 Enterprise. Please secure it. Extract the ZIP file and start installing. You will reach this page first.  Select , the first option, New SQL Server stand-alone installation or add features to an existing installation   On the next screen, the setup will scan fore relevant updates. This is optional. If your target setup device isn\u0026rsquo;t connected to the internet, you can skip this step by unchecking the option and clicking next. The next setup screen will deal with installed instances of SQL Servers in the computer you are trying to install.  If there is already a software product running, it is a good idea to make another instance. To do this, you should select Add features to an existing instance of SQL Server 2012 and provide a new Server Instance Name (example: MSSQLSERVER2012) If it is a new system, or if the old system does not matter(Consult the IT Department of the institution), then go ahead and Perform a new installation of SQL Server 2012 Perform a new installation of SQL Server 2012 is better for our purposes.  The product key, asked on the next screen, should already be available with the installation media.  If it is not, please copy paste 748RB-X4T6B-MRM7V-RTVFF-CHC8H  Next,  select SQL Server Feature Installation  choose all Instance Features along with Management Tools(Basic \u0026amp; Complete)   If you have selected Add features to an existing instance of SQL Server 2012 in the previous steps, you\u0026rsquo;ll have an option to name a new instance in the following screen. Otherwise, just proceed and complete the setup as usual.  SQL Server 2012 Enterprise should be now properly set up.    \r  After opening Management studio, connect to a database engine (SQL Server instance). In this step, Please be careful in choosing the correct instance, if there are multiple servers or, instances. Note down the instance name and host name if there are more than one.\n\r Now restore the required database with the .bak file. It should be available, for download, in pre-requisites Finally, go to connected database engine \u0026gt; Logins and right-click to create a new login.  On the login name, paste IIS APPPOOL\\.NET 4.5 Give appropriate Server Roles and User Mapping. Generally Read/Write access(ie. db datareader / db datawriter) is enough. When selecting User Mapping, it is important to first select the target database \r  The device is now properly prepared for IIS  Open the IIS Manager\n Press Win+R and type inetmgr then, hit ENTER If this does not open IIS Manager, press Win+R, type optionalfeatures, hit ENTER.  Enable IIS along with associated .NET Services.   It is very important to check if all the features in the following section are enabled.\nInternet Information Services \u0026gt; World Wide Web Services \u0026gt; Application Development Features \u0026gt; *  These are expected to be enabled. CGI and FTP are optional for this particular setup\n  Click here to view screenshot of relevant optional features     \r    On the IIS Manager, create a frontend and a backend, in each case.\n Ensure that the binding is taking place properly.  Bind with all IP Addresses i.e.* and, specific ports (say) :88 and :99.  Add .NET 4.5 to the application pool *The host files for both are associated with .NET 4.5 Framework. We have installed .NET 4.5.2 because, at the moment, it is our fronend dependency. .NET 4.5.2 is an in-place replacement for .NET 4.5 and .NET 4.0 . This means, no other frameworks are needed to be installed.\n\r The default .NET framework for Windows 7 is .NET 3.5 and it will NOT show any newer .NET framework in the optionalfeatures list even if you install it in your device. However, .NET 4.5 is vital to your Application Pool. To enable .NET 4.5 manually, run this command in cmd.exe with Administrative priviledge.  %windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\aspnet_regiis.exe -ir  The above command runs successfully only when you install .NET 4.5.2 Framework first\n\r The .NET 4.5 will still not show up in your Application pool. But you can now manually make an entry like follows:  Name: .NET 4.5 .NET Framework Version: .NET Framework v4.0.30319 Managed pipeline mode: Integrated [âœ“] : Start application pool immediately   Then on the host file Basic setting(i.e.IIS Manager \u0026gt; IMS-UI \u0026gt; Basic Setting) you will be finally able to select .NET 4.5   Finally, double check your preparation by hitting the server.  If you browse the server, it should display a similar kind of footer information to this:\nVersion Information: Microsoft .NET Framework Version:4.0.30319; ASP.NET Version:4.0.30319.34209  along with a standard 404 Error.\n  \r If you\u0026rsquo;re getting Error 500 or 503, something has gone terribly wrong in the previous steps. Also, browse your fronend. It should be able to open but, should not be able to access the server.   "

If it is unable, first configure the binding setup in the IIS itself. Or, check if you have failed to follow the previous steps properly.\n\rConfiguring IIS to our needs  Press Win+R and type inetmgr Go to Basic Settings and ensure Application pool is .NET 4.5 in both frontend and backend Next, click on Binding Settings and choose the port and IP, with which, you want the local network to interact with the IIS. Consult the Network administrator about the type of network they are using. If they are unsure, do not use a static IP Address.\nIf the Local Network Router is configured to provide Dynamic IP Address (i.e. DHCP without Address Reservation), you have to choose IP Address as All Unassigned, i.e. *\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t do this on a dynamic IP network, your computer could take another IP address in the future, making this setup useless.\n \r  Modify the Host configuration files  common.services\n This file is present in the front-end and it tells the host to connect to a particular backend. You can use Localhost followed by a port number to specify connection if the database server exists in the same computer e.g.Localhost:88  Web.config\n This setting can also be configured firectly from IIS Manager \u0026gt; Connection Strings This file is present in the back-end and it tells the host to connect to a particular database engine or instance. It can also be configured to connect to a database engine running on a connected local computer on the network. For our purposes, we use the following setting\nData Source=Localhost;Initial Catalog=SMS2;Integrated Security=True;  if there is a seperate SQL Server Instance, during setup, the host-name followed by / and the instance name should be used.\nData Source=Siddhant-PC\\MSSQLSERVER2012;Initial Catalog=SMS2;Integrated Security=True;  using . instead of the host-name points to the same computer.\nData Source=.\\MSSQLSERVER2012;Initial Catalog=SMS2;Integrated Security=True;  \r  Host configuration is now complete\n  Setting up the firewall  Press Win+R and type firewall.cpl, then hit ENTER Click Advanced Settings on the left pane Create an outbound rule for the two ports that you\u0026rsquo;ve used for frontend and backend Similarly, create an inbound rule for the same two ports Firewall setup is complete  "

	"content": "Here are some common issues that you may face while performing this setup\n SQL backup file refuses to restore into the database  Ensure that you are using an instance of SQL Server 2012 while connecting to the database-engine from SQL Server Management Studio. If there are multiple named instances, choosing the incorrect one will create this problem. If all else fails, this can be generally resolved by installing SQL Server 2012. (Please see pre-requisites).  Can\u0026rsquo;t see .NET 4.5 in the App Pool  This is a problem with older OS (Windows 7) Windows-7 comes preloaded with .NET 3.5 and any newer versions will not show up in optionalfeatures However, it is possible to add a .NET 4.5 entry manually in the App Pool(Please see preparing the devive)  IIS Frontend produces errors when I run it  Frontend is generally fault tolerant but if there is an error, it is due to the unavailability of .NET 4.5.2, which it requires. Ensure that .NET 4.5.2 is installed Ensure that .NET 4.5 is setup as the Application Pool in Frontend Basic Settings.  ISS Frontend seems to load but the page is stuck at Login screen  Frontend is pretty fault tolerant This means there is a problem in the backend or, there might be a problem connecting to SQL database Ensure that IIS Backend Connection Strings are properly configured Ensure that, if there are multiple SQL named instances, your database-engine is connecing to the right one. Ensure that your connection string has the proper source Localhost or, Siddhant-PC\\MSSQLSERVER2012 or, .\\MSSQLSERVER2012 according to the number of installed instances. You can manually edit this in Web.Config. Ensure that common.services is pointing to the right IP Address. Using Localhost:88 format is often more effective in reducing errors. Ensure that hostfile is getting proper SQL Server Access. Make a manual login entry to fix this. See preparing-the-device  I\u0026rsquo;m trying to fix by following the steps, but it is not working!  One of two things is happening,  (Incase of backend problem) Either your SQL Server instance hasn\u0026rsquo;t restarted since the last change (Incase of frontend problem) Or, your browser is caching up the previous data, making changes in static content (like js and config) not apparent.  Fix by opening services(Win+R and type services.msc) and restarting your SQL Server Instance. Fix by clearing cache or, restarting Incognito mode.   If your problem still hasn\u0026rsquo;t resolved, contact a qualified personell at Soanitech Nepal Pvt. Ltd\n\r"
